# Welcome to my personal website

Hi, I'm Julie, researcher in biology, dedicated to understand *weird eukaryotic genomes*, i.e. **protist genomes**.

I have a **bioinformatics** and **evolutionary biology** background.

I am a microbial eukaryotes enthusiast as well as a passionate (meta)genome hunter.

## Current projects

### Upgrading microbial genomics

#### Integrating long-read sequencing for enhanced taxonomic and metagenomic information

In the intricate web of life, tiny microorganisms like **protists** and **prokaryotes** play monumental roles, often unseen and unrecognized. Think of them as nature's backstage crew, essential but behind the scenes. However, studying them isn't always straightforward. Current techniques can be likened to trying to understand a puzzle with many pieces missing. I aim to change that.

With cutting-edge technology, my plan is to bring these hidden worlds to light. Imagine having a more powerful microscope that lets us see with more detail and clarity. Long-read sequencing is akin to that. It provides a more comprehensive view of microbial life by reading longer DNA segments, letting us identify these organisms with unmatched precision.

But why does this matter? A better understanding of these micro-worlds can guide us in maintaining ecological balance, conserving habitats, and even discovering potential medical and biotechnological breakthroughs. 

In essence, with better tools, we're not just seeing more; we're understanding more. 

### Protists -omics

#### Diving into Protists diversity through Long-Reads Metabarcoding, Metagenomics and Whole Genome Sequencing

Microbial eukaryotes play a vital role in ecosystems by supporting nutrient cycling, food chains, and biodiversity. 

To better understand their genomic diversity, I am developping advanced long-read sequencing analysis workflows, which allow us to explore their complexity more thoroughly than traditional methods. 

My research focuses on **whole-genome sequencing** of anaerobic protists - organisms involved in metabolic partnerships with prokaryotes, metagenomic sequencing of associated prokaryotes, and long-read metabarcoding of anoxic sediments collected from various Swedish environments.

**Long-read sequencing** enables comprehensive -omic analysis, provides higher resolution for species identification in case of metabarcoding and deeper insights through high-quality whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing. 

This approach allows to explore both the taxonomic diversity and functional complexity of microbial communities, offering a more complete understanding of their ecological roles in anoxic environments. 

This project will help address the significant lack of genomic references for non-model eukaryotes, contributing valuable data to global databases and supporting future research in microbial ecology and evolutionary biology.
