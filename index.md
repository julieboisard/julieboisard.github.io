## Genome Architecture in Early-Diverging Eukaryotes

<p class="hero-subtitle">How does genome structure evolve across the eukaryotic tree of life?</p>

### About

I am an evolutionary genomicist studying genome architecture in early-diverging eukaryotes.

My research integrates long-read genomics, comparative analysis, and bioinformatic tool development to examine how structural genome features evolve beyond gene inventories.

By focusing on undersampled protist lineages, my work expands phylogenetic representation and helps refine models of eukaryotic genome evolution.

### Research Overview

#### 1. Genome Architecture and Structural Evolution

Protein-coding genes represent only one layer of genome evolution, while large fractions of eukaryotic genomes consist of repetitive elements, non-coding regions, and structural features whose evolutionary dynamics remain poorly characterised in early-diverging lineages.

I am interested in how these structural components:

* vary across related species
* reshape genome organisation
* interact with processes such as rearrangement and transposable element activity

My work examines genome architecture as an evolutionary dimension that may follow trajectories partially independent from gene repertoire change.


#### 2. Bioinformatic Tool Development for Comparative Genomics

Studying genome architecture in divergent eukaryotes requires methodological innovation.

I develop and implement reproducible bioinformatic frameworks to support:

* structural genome annotation
* repeat landscape analysis
* integrative evidence scoring
* phylogenetically informed comparative analyses

Tool development in my research is driven by biological questions and improves analytical resolution in phylogenetically divergent, non-model systems.

#### 3. Protist Biodiversity and Deep Eukaryotic Lineages

Protists represent the majority of eukaryotic diversity yet remain underrepresented in genomic databases.

Through the generation and analysis of high-contiguity genome assemblies from undersampled taxa, my research improves phylogenetic representation and documents structural genome variation among understudied eukaryotic lineages.

These data provide comparative frameworks for reconstructing early eukaryotic genome evolution.
